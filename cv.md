## Quick Facts

  * Name: Tom Van Cutsem
  * Nationality: Belgian <span title="BE" class="flag-icon flag-icon-be flag-icon-squared"></span>
  * Residence: Leuven, Belgium
  * Language proficiency: Dutch (Mother Tongue), English (Fluent)
  * Degree: PhD, Computer Science
  * Profession: R&amp;D team leader, computer science researcher, software architect, software technologist

## Past work that I am proud of

*   Designed a search engine for software packages called [Code Compass](https://www.code-compass.com/) powered by unsupervised machine learning algorithms (joint work with colleagues from Nokia Bell Labs).
*   Built a wide-area distributed stream processing platform for IoT called [World-wide Streams](https://www.worldwidestreams.io/) (joint work with multiple colleagues from Nokia Bell Labs).
*   Contributed to the JavaScript (ECMAScript) standard. Designed the [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) Proxy and Reflect reflection APIs (joint work with Mark S. Miller from Google).
*   Together with Stijn Mostinckx at the University of Brussels, designed and implemented the distributed, open-source [AmbientTalk](http://soft.vub.ac.be/amop/) programming language.
*   Organized the 2013 [Flemish Programming Contest](http://www.vlaamseprogrammeerwedstrijd.be/2013/), a regional ACM-style programming contest, attracting 500 participants.
*   Author of [reflect.js](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect), a Javascript reflection library making the ECMAScript 6 reflection API available on current platforms.
*   Together with Dries Harnie, Joeri De Koster and Theo D'Hondt, designed [SchemeKen](https://github.com/tvcutsem/schemeken), a distributed, resilient dialect of Scheme.
*   Author of [traits.js](https://github.com/traitsjs/traits.js), a minimal trait composition library for Javascript.
*   Independently developed a 26-hour lecture series at university Master-level on [multicore programming](http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/multicore/) and an introductory university Bachelor-level course on [distributed systems](http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/distsys/).
*   Author of [stm-in-clojure](https://github.com/tvcutsem/stm-in-clojure), a meta-circular implementation of software-transactional memory in Clojure. I use this library for teaching STM in my university course on [multicore programming](http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/multicore/).
*   As a CS student, worked on several programming projects including a [compiler for a C-like language for the JVM written in C++](https://github.com/tvcutsem/tinyc), a mobile agent travel reservation system in Java, a 3D rendering engine based on Binary Space Partitions, a text-based RPG, and a spreadsheet in PLT Scheme (now PLT Racket).

## Skills

### Soft Skills

Team leadership, delivering talks and technical pitches, coaching people, coordinating a development team (in an architect role). Excellent writing skills.

### Technical Skills

Very strong software design and software engineering skills. Deep understanding of programming languages, compilers, virtual machines. Deep understanding of distributed systems. Hands-on experience with node.js, Cloud/AWS, Docker, RabbitMQ, MongoDB. Ask me about distributed systems concepts such as consistency, availability and partition-tolerance.

Good understanding of Machine learning and its possibilities (classification/regression, supervised/unsupervised) and pitfalls (bias, overfitting). I've wrangled data and trained models with Python.

I consider myself proficient (i.e. have written programs over 10K SLoC) in Java and JavaScript (node.js) but have used a wide variety of different languages
and systems, including C/C++, Prolog, Python, Erlang, Clojure and Smalltalk. I pick up new languages easily.

Expert in object-oriented software development, design patterns, TDD/BDD. Also strong affinity with functional, relational and logic programming paradigms.

Expert in multi-user (concurrent) systems, distributed computing, parallel computing, peer-to-peer systems.

Good understanding of basic security principles, authentication, encryption/verification and key networking principles.
