    *   2nd year / 2de kandidatuur (july 2002): Summa Cum Laude / Grootste Onderscheiding
    *   3rd year / 1ste licentie (july 2003): Summa Cum Laude / Grootste Onderscheiding
    *   4th year / 2de licentie (july 2004): Summa Cum Laude / Grootste Onderscheiding
    *   **Honors:** Received the 'Science Award' of the VUB Faculty of Sciences in July 2004\. Awarded yearly by the faculty of sciences to the student with the best merits seen across the entire career of study.

## Achievements

*   Built a wide-area distributed stream processing platform for IoT called [World-wide Streams](https://www.worldwidestreams.io/) (joint work with multiple colleagues from Nokia Bell Labs).
*   Active contributor to the JavaScript standard. Designed the [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) Proxy and Reflect reflection APIs (joint work with Mark S. Miller from Google).
*   Together with Stijn Mostinckx at the University of Brussels, designed and implemented the distributed, open-source [AmbientTalk](http://soft.vub.ac.be/amop/) programming language.
*   Organized the 2013 [Flemish Programming Contest](http://www.vlaamseprogrammeerwedstrijd.be/2013/), a regional ACM-style programming contest, attracting 500 participants.
*   Author of [reflect.js](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect), a Javascript reflection library making the ECMAScript 6 reflection API available on current platforms.
*   Together with Dries Harnie, Joeri De Koster and Theo D'Hondt, designed [SchemeKen](https://github.com/tvcutsem/schemeken), a distributed, resilient dialect of Scheme.
*   Author of [traits.js](https://github.com/traitsjs/traits.js), a minimal trait composition library for Javascript.
*   Independently developed a 26-hour lecture series at university Master-level on [multicore programming](http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/multicore/) and an introductory university Bachelor-level course on [distributed systems](http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/distsys/).
*   Author of [stm-in-clojure](https://github.com/tvcutsem/stm-in-clojure), a meta-circular implementation of software-transactional memory in Clojure. I use this library for teaching STM in my university course on [multicore programming](http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/multicore/).
*   As a CS student, worked on several programming projects including a compiler for a C-like language for the JVM written in C++, a mobile agent travel reservation system in Java, a 3D rendering engine based on Binary Space Partitions, a text-based RPG, and a spreadsheet in PLT Scheme (now PLT Racket).

## Technical Skills and Competences

Writing project proposals, reviewing papers, writing technical documents, research, guiding people, good software design and engineering skills.

I have experience in working in a software development team on small to medium-scale projects. In the context of my PhD research, I developed my own programming language in a team of 6 people. I managed most of the project: designing the system, coding the system, performing task management, version control, unit testing, bug tracking, website maintenance, etc. Task management included setting milestones, deadlines, dividing the work load between team members and the organization of meetings.

I am familiar with the traditional 'waterfall' model, but also have experience with **agile programming**, extreme programming and iterative development backed by rigorous **unit testing**.

Knowledge of: Java technology stack, Eclipse, C/C++, Scripting (JavaScript, Python, Ruby), MySQL, version-control systems (Git/CVS/SVN). Experience in a wide array of (academic and industrial) programming languages (Erlang, Clojure, Prolog, Smalltalk, ...). Expert in object-oriented technology, software development (analysis, design, design patterns and implementation) and programming languages. Thorough knowledge of compiler- and interpreter development, distributed, parallel and concurrent platforms and frameworks, transaction processing. Knowledge of **web development** (JavaScript, Ruby on rails, node.js) and content-management systems (drupal, wordpress).
