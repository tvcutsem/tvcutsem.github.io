Our demonstrator "Building Connected Car Applications on top of the World-Wide Streams Platform" received the Best Demo Award at [DEBS 2017](http://www.debs2017.org/), the ACM conference on distributed and event-based systems.

The demo showcases the capabilities of World-wide Streams, a wide-area distributed stream processing platform that I helped build at Nokia Bell Labs. The demo is a fleet management application for connected cars, processing the telemetry data and dashcam video streams emitted by cars in real-time.
