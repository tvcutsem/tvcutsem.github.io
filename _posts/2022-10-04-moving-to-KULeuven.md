After (almost) 9 years at [Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com) (first as a researcher, then as a department head) I have recently made the decision to move back to academia, while remaining affiliated with the Labs in a limited advisory research role.

As of this week I am part of the faculty at the [Computer Science Department](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/) in KU Leuven as an Associate Professor where I will be pursuing research and teaching on distributed systems, blockchain and software security in the [DistriNet](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/) research group.

In this new role I will bootstrap a new line of research on secure distributed computing with a focus on building and securing decentralized applications, in particular applications that employ "smart contracts", i.e. code that manages digital assets, usually recorded on blockchain-based ledgers. Specific topics of interest include the study of new and widely used languages for writing smart contracts and system-level challenges of blockchain platforms including their security, privacy, scalability and interoperability.

I'm looking for Master students interested in pursuing a PhD in any of these areas. I have an [open position](https://www.kuleuven.be/personeel/jobsite/jobs/60161226) for a 4-year full-time PhD research assistant appointment in Leuven, Belgium. For any questions about the topic, don't hesitate to reach out at `tom.vancutsem` at `kuleuven.be`. For practical questions regarding working conditions for PhD students at KU Leuven, check [this helpful website](https://www.kuleuven.be/personeel/jobsite/en/phd/phd-information) from the university.

**Update:** my inaugural lecture slides on secure and dependable software services for the Internet of Value are available [here](/assets/Inaugural_Lecture_KULeuven_11_2022.pdf).
